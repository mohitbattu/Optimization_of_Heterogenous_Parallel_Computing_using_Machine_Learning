# Strassen Algorithm

Implementation of the Strassen Algorithm in C

        The Strassen algorithm, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster
        than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm, but would be slower than the
        fastest known algorithms for extremely large matrices.
